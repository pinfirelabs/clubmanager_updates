## New Checkout Kiosk Modes

The Equipment Checkout tablet view (Equipment -> Equipment Checkouts) can now work in one of three modes:
* Admin approval mode: Members request checkouts on the tablet.  Those are verified by staff in the "View pending checkouts" screen.
* No check mode: Members can check out any equipment in the system in a completely self-serve fashion.  Membership and rating checks are not enforced.
* User self-service checks: New in this version, members can check out Equipment, but are blocked and notified to contact the office if they lack a rating or if their membership has lapsed.
