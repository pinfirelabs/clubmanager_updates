# New features - Other

## New Customer Onboarding

We've built out a complete onboarding tool for new (and existing) clients.  With this tool, we now offer an easy way to quickly introduce people to *Pinfire Club Manager*.  It offers a one-click method to email your members and a quick wizard they can use to:
* Set up a username/password
* Sign an electronic waiver
* Set up / confirm recurring billing information (optional, if your club did a credit card import, confirming what is on file)

## New Customer Imports

We now offer a one-page spreadsheet to new (and existing) clients to import their information into the system.  It allows us to offer low-cost importing of member contact info, ratings, membership info, email list assignments, permission groups and a link to the onboarding wizard (see above).

In addition, through a partnership with [Spreedly](https://www.spreedly.com), we are now able to help coordinate credit card imports from a wide variety of payment processors into *Pinfire Club Manager*.  This way, moving to PCM will not require regathering credit cards from your members.  

_Please note, credit card imports will require an additional one-time fee to cover time and costs._

# Improvements
* We now cleanly show quantity on invoices/receipts so if you sell 100 of the same item, it will now show with a quantity of 100, not 100 lines.
* We've added a new invoicing display area (Financial -> Invoices / Quotes) that will show you all invoices broken down by type.  We've also included a new page where you can view all details about a transaction including payment history (with processor information, depending on which payment processor / gateway you are running credit card payments through), including transaction notes.
* We've added a new widget for entering timespans for events that works the same in all browsers and platforms.
* We've added the ability to have leaderless events and also prevent yourself from being set as the default leader on new events.  Contact us to trigger either of these settings for you.
* As many clubs are using our volunteer hour tracking to keep track of sailing credits / punch cards, we've added options to change the copy to match how clubs are using the field.  Contact us if you'd like to see "Sailing Credits" instead of "Volunteer Hours"
* If you've defined custom fields for events, you can now use those on event templates as well.
* We improved the event chooser in the Point of Sale system (POS) to let you filter by category, dates and more.
* You'll notice a new "Create Sale" button on any contact's user profile, allowing you to quick enter the POS to complete a sale to them.  You'll also see a similar button on an event page that lets you quickly get into the POS to sell an event to a customer.
* Basic international address support:  If you have customers outside the US, we can flip on basic support for international address.  This will let them pick a country and if not in the US, we will not require the state and zip code fields.
* New reports: we've added a bunch of new reports under the Custom Reports tab to give you more visibility into your club's functions:
    * Equipment Usage Log - shows all usage of equipment
    * Audit Log - shows actions your staff and members are doing in the system.
    * Event Participants with Custom Fields - shows all event participants within a date range, along with custom fields on their user profile.
        * Need a custom field?  Contact us at support to get one set up!
* We've redone the UI on the Equipment Reservations section of the Equipment Loan Dashboard to give you better visibility into your upcoming equipment usage.
* We've added member status (e.g. Active Member), phone number and email in the POS customer chooser to let you more easily pick between multiple customers who have the same name.
* If you wish to keep details private, we can now hide participant counts from the event page or listing of events.
* We've added options to control the number of days that appear by default on the equipment reservation calendar.
